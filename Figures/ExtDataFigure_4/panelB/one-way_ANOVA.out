[1] ### Check assumptions ###
[1] 1) Checking the presence of outliers
[1] No outliers found: This assumption is verified
[1] 
[1] 2) Checking normality assumption
[1] # Building the linear model
[1] # Creating a QQ plot of residuals
[1] ### Compute Shapiro-Wilk test of normality ###
# A tibble: 1 × 3
  variable         statistic p.value
  <chr>                <dbl>   <dbl>
1 residuals(model)     0.794  0.0361
[1] The normality assumption is not supported by the Shapiro-Wilk test. The p-value is significant (p = 0.0360679186842028),
[1] so we cannot assume normality for this dataset.
[1] 
[1] 3) Checking homogeneity of variance assumption
[1] This can be checked using the Levene’s test:
# A tibble: 1 × 4
    df1   df2 statistic        p
  <int> <int>     <dbl>    <dbl>
1     2     4   1.09e33 3.35e-66
[1] The Levene’s test is not significant (p > 3.35161801544554e-66). Therefore, we can assume the homogeneity of variances in the different groups.
[1] ### Computation of the one-way ANOVA test ###
[1] In the R code below, the asterisk represents the interaction effect and the main effect of each variable (and all lower-order interactions).

[1] ### Post-hoct tests ###
[1] ### Procedure for significant one-way interaction ###
[1] ### Compute pairwise comparisons ###
[1] To determine which group means are different. We’ll now perform multiple pairwise comparisons between the different conditions.
[1] You can run and interpret all possible pairwise comparisons using a Bonferroni adjustment.
[1] This can be easily done using the function emmeans_test() [rstatix package], a wrapper around the emmeans package,
[1] which needs to be installed. Emmeans stands for estimated marginal means (aka least square means or adjusted means).
[1] Compare the values of the different cellType levels by condition levels:

[1] In the QQ plot, as all the points fall approximately along the reference line, we can assume normality.
